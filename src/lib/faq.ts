    answer: "Unlike one-size-fits-all pills, our approach treats the 3 real root causes of PCOD/PCOS: hormonal imbalance, toxin buildup, and disrupted cycles. Each kit is made from classical Ayurvedic granthas and designed as a daily ritual, not a temporary fix."

Most women experience improved digestion, better energy, and lighter cycles — with no side effects when taken as guided."
